# Algorithm Basics

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language. Algorithms are the foundational pieces for writing computer programs and each algorithm represent a blue print for a computeter program. Both Algorithm and flowchart are two types of tools to explain the process of a program. The difference is that Algorithm is typically written as plain english step by step whereas flowchart is graphical representation of the program flow. 

## How to Write an Algorithm?
There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code
As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.
  
We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.

## examples

Here are a series of simple programs with algirithms for each:
