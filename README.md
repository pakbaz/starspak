Knowledge for All, exactly what you need to know. no less no more.

## Motivation

Although, there are a lot of great learning platforms/services for everyone out there, most of them costs money and/or lack clear direction, cohesive goal and many are biased toward specific platform or company whether the contents are relevant or not therefore, doesn't have learners best interest in mind rather are part of commercial budget.
Morover, classic academic approach for mastering any specific topic, regardless of the level, is greatly time-consuming and very expensive as the most important/least important content put together and may take months or years to master.

We believe there is room for a free, open source, unbiased and high-quality learning platform with conscise materials free of ads and cross platform support.

## Core Principals

* Quality, carefully curated content free for all
* Contents are educational but also practical with real world examples. It is made to get you ready for a job or a promotion.
* Open source, platform neutrual and popular/on demand knowledge/content/services gets favorable focus. The only way a commercial platform gets the content published is that the clear advantage for learners can be justified. Examples of these could be learning materials for popular Commercial Cloud platforms.
* All Core educational and practical Contents are (and always will be) free and open source
