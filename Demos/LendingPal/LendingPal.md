# LendingPal App

**Background**: You and your college friends in dormitory borrowing and lending money from each other for different reasons.
**Problem**: At some point in time, you lost track of how much money anyone owes to or borrowed from anyone else of your friends

## Microsoft Excel

Easiest way to keep track of it is by putting it into Microsoft Excel and a template like this:

|Borrower|Lender|Amount|
|:-------|:-----|-----:|
|Liam|John|$10.00|
|John|Chris|$30.00
|Scott|Chris|$35.00
|Chris|Liam|$20.00

Perhaps we also add date and comments and we come up with Something Like this:
[Excel File](https://1drv.ms/x/s!At350RUr0MbXg6hRg08ZcWvJ6YVg8Q?e=o3zOel)

Its easy to put data in the excel file but even in Microsoft Excel it is really hard to quickly find out who owes whom how much money at any given point in time. The best thing we can come up with in excel without the use of Macros which we don't know much about anyway is to implement a pivot Table and perhaps adding a Chart but even that is not super clear
